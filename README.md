# SixNet, a Windows-based telnet BBS with full ANSI and PETSCII support
This system is based loosely on the old C64 and Amiga C-Net BBS software.
A database creation script is included.  
For production use, you'll need to update the connectionstrings in the config files.  
Passwords have been replaced with generic versions.
