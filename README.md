# SixNet, a Windows-based telnet BBS with full ANSI and PETSCII support

This is a WIP, there's still lots to do.  
This system is based loosely on the old C64 and Amiga C-Net BBS software.
I've included a script to create database connections.  
You'll need to update the connectionstrings in the config files.  
Passwords have been replaced with generic versions.

## What's new:
* Basic Slack integration to report logins/logouts to channel

## What works:

* PETSCII support - this is the most complete feature
* ANSI support - much still to be done, but it works
* Sysop chat
* New user application
* Feedback and message editor
* Message bases with tree-based navigation (Main->Area->SubArea->Message Base->File)
* Message threading
* Finding new messages, reading messages, posting messages, replying to messages
* System-wide news displayed at login
* Graffiti Wall
* Last 10 Callers 
* G-File (text) libraries with tree-based navigation (Main->Area->SubArea->Gfile Base->File)
* Up/Download areas with tree-based navigation (Main->Area->SubArea->UD Base->file)
* XMODEM up/download
* PUNTER up/download
* P-File areas (DOORS) with tree-based navigation (Main->Area->SubArea->PFile Base->PFile)
* Clone of EMPIRE
* Dopewars
* Inter-node chat
* SysOp feedback feature
* Logoff

## What needs some work still:
* ANSI/PETSCII visual message editor (WYSIWYG editor, not line-based)
* Message editor menus and added features (list/re-edit/delete)
* All menus and screens

## What DOESN'T work yet, or is planned and not implemented
* IRC interface
* All SysOp menus
* GUI editors for all database objects
* Main GUI display
* YMODEM, ZMODEM, Kermit
* Web interface
* FTP
* SSH
* SixMUD
* Hangman
* Inter-node chess and tic-tac-toe
